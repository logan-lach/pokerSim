This is a poker simulation!

I want to get familiar with Rust so I am making a poker simulation, it will try and use the best mathematical techniques and be used as a trainer

It will have the ability to play live poker (duh), it will have a multiplayer live option, and it will have different AI that will be smarter about how the user plays

Things I need to do

- Learn Rust
- Learn how to make a GUI in Rust
- Setup a live server 
- Setup user account so they can actively communicate with games
